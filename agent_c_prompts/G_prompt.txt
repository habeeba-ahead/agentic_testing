Only the BRD is available. Where text is ambiguous, generate up to 2 hypotheses per domain with confidence and explicit assumptions.

For each domain:
name, hypotheses[{assumption, scope, drivers[], workstreams[], priority, confidence, evidence[]}].

Also provide a merge_recommendation explaining how to resolve ambiguity (what to ask for).

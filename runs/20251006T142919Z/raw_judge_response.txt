      "prompt": "A_prompt",
      "score": 68,
      "reasons": "Monolithic app.tf approach, backend.tf has invalid string interpolation in backend block, minimal adapter files, missing comprehensive test coverage"

      "reasons": "Not a valid agent output bundle - appears to be evaluation metadata rather than infrastructure/code bundle"
    }
  ],
  "winner": "C_prompt",
  "notes": "C_prompt wins with best Terraform practices (proper backend config comments, fileexists guards, modular structure), includes test files meeting BRD requirements, and has comprehensive IAM policies. B_prompt close second with good modularization but backend syntax issues. A_prompt functional but monolithic and missing tests. All candidates need CloudWatch alarms implementation per guardrails."

    {
      "prompt": "prompt_a",
      "score": 92,
      "reasons": "Excellent guardrail alignment (serverless-first with Lambda/DynamoDB/Aurora), explicit CloudMapping per service, comprehensive risk mitigations, numeric NFRs, strong IaC mappability."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "prompt_b",
      "score": 78,
      "reasons": "Good structure and completeness but weaker CloudMapping detail (generic 'compute/database' vs. explicit Lambda/DynamoDB), less concrete IaC guidance, some missing numeric targets in NFRs."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "prompt_c",
      "score": 65,
      "reasons": "Adequate coverage but significant guardrail deviation (suggests ECS/EKS without serverless-first justification), vague CloudMapping, risks lack concrete mitigations, lower IaC readiness."
    }
  ],
  "winner": "prompt_a",
  "notes": "prompt_a wins decisively on guardrail alignment (serverless-first strictly followed), IaC mappability (explicit AWS service names per component), and risk clarity (concrete migration steps with rollback). prompt_b is solid but less prescriptive for IaC generation. prompt_c deviates from serverless-first mandate without justification, reducing consistency and IaC confidence."

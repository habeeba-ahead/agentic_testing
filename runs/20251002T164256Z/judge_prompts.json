  "winner": "E_combined",
  "notes": "E_combined and A_schema_compiler both excel at guardrail alignment (x3 weight) and IaC mappability (x4 weight). E_combined wins by tighter service definitions, clearer BRD-vs-guardrail conflict resolution in Risks (EC2 lift-and-shift vs serverless-first), and slightly more actionable Constraints. Both correctly map to Lambda/DynamoDB/Aurora Serverless v2/EventBridge/SQS per guardrails. C_catalog_first and D_diff_to_target provide useful content but lack required XML structure. B_critic_refine's missing tags and prose-heavy format make it unsuitable for downstream IaC tooling despite reasonable guardrail adherence in narrative."

  "system": "Application Modernization & Migration to AWS (Terraform + Python)",
  "summary": "The BRD describes a lift-and-shift migration of an on-premises x86 application to AWS Cloud, with future containerization planned. Infrastructure will be provisioned using Terraform IaC, and Python will automate workflows. The migration must satisfy Minimum Entry Criteria (MEC) covering OS versions, patching, backup/DR, and monitoring. Key modernization domains include Application (lift-and-shift to EC2, future ECS/EKS), Data (RDS migration via DMS), Infrastructure (VPC, compute, storage), Security & Compliance (IAM, encryption, MEC validation), and Operations/Platform (CloudWatch, CI/CD pipelines). Cross-domain dependencies exist between Infrastructure provisioning and Application deployment, and between Security baselines and Data migration. The BRD emphasizes cost efficiency, HA/DR, and post-cutover hypercare.",

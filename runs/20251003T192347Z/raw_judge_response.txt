  "winner": "C_prompt",
  "notes": "C_prompt edges out I_prompt with slightly better conciseness and no hallucination risk (I_prompt introduces 'Java SOAP' not in BRD). Top 4 candidates (C, I, D, F) all demonstrate excellent coverage (7-8 domains), strong evidence fidelity, and actionable workstreams. C_prompt's Integration domain and precise BRD locators give it the edge. B_prompt and A_prompt score well but lack Integration/Governance domains. JUDGE_prompt_quality offers a valid alternative structure but is less actionable for immediate implementation planning."

      "score": 91,
      "reasons": "Excellent structure with all required tags, strong CloudMapping detail, comprehensive Services breakdown, but slightly verbose and some risks address BRD-guardrail tension less concisely."

      "prompt": "C_catalog_first",
      "score": 68,
      "reasons": "Good component catalog and observability detail, but missing critical tags (CloudMapping, Constraints, Services), no numeric NFR targets, and incomplete IaC mappability."

      "prompt": "D_diff_to_target",
      "score": 65,
      "reasons": "Strong current-vs-target analysis and decision rationale, but missing CloudMapping/Services/Patterns tags, no numeric NFRs, and less actionable for direct IaC generation."

    {
      "prompt": "B_critic_refine",
      "score": 42,
      "reasons": "Comprehensive narrative with quality attributes, but critically missing all 8 required XML tags, no CloudMapping sections, no numeric NFRs, and poor IaC mappability."

  ],
  "winner": "E_combined",
  "notes": "E_combined wins by balancing completeness, guardrail fidelity, and IaC readiness. It captures the BRD's EC2/ECS mention as a risk while adhering to serverless-first, provides explicit AWS service mappings for every layer, and includes numeric SLAs. A_schema_compiler is a close second with richer service decomposition but slightly over-engineers the domain model. B_critic_refine fails structural requirements despite good prose. C and D lack critical tags and numeric targets."

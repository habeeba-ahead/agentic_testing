  "winner": "B_prompt",
  "notes": "All three candidates meet core requirements. B_prompt edges ahead with superior observability (structured JSON logging), better error handling in glue adapters, and integration tests. A_prompt provides a clean, functional baseline. C_prompt's separate policy files aid maintainability but thin glue wrappers and potential packaging conflicts lower deployability confidence."

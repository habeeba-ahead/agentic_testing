  "winner": "prompt_a",
  "notes": "All three prompts fail guardrail alignment catastrophically by proposing lift-and-shift EC2/ECS/RDS architectures when guardrails mandate serverless-first (Lambda/DynamoDB/Aurora Serverless/EventBridge/API Gateway). Prompt_a scores marginally higher due to slightly better risk articulation and constraint clarity, but none are suitable for downstream IaC generation without complete redesign to serverless patterns."

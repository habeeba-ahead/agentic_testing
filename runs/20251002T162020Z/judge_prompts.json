  "winner": "A_schema_compiler",
  "notes": "A_schema_compiler dominates with 100% mandatory tag coverage, explicit CloudMapping for all 5 categories (Compute/Networking/Data/Messaging/Identity), numeric NFR targets (99.9% availability, 500ms p95, 100 rps), and actionable IaC mappings. It correctly addresses the BRD's EC2 lift-and-shift vs. guardrails' serverless-first tension via Strangler Fig pattern in Risks. Other prompts lack critical ArchitectureSpec structure: B missing all 8 tags, C/D missing 6+ tags and CloudMapping sections, making them unsuitable for downstream IaC generation despite some strong narrative content."

  "notes": "B_prompt edges out C_prompt with slightly better prioritization logic and clearer dependency mapping. Top 4 candidates (B, C, I, H) all deliver 8-domain coverage with strong evidence fidelity and actionable workstreams. A_prompt and E_prompt lose points for missing Integration/Governance domains. JUDGE_prompt_quality uses a different schema and lower domain granularity, scoring lowest despite good thematic analysis."

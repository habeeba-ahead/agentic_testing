  "summary": "The BRD describes a lift-and-shift migration of an on-premises x86 application to AWS Cloud, with future containerization planned. Infrastructure will be provisioned using Terraform IaC, and Python will automate workflows. The migration must satisfy Minimum Entry Criteria (MEC) covering OS versions, patching, backup/DR, and monitoring. Key modernization domains include Application (lift-shift to EC2, future ECS/EKS), Infrastructure (VPC, compute, storage), Data (RDS, S3, DMS migration), Security & Compliance (IAM, KMS, MEC validation), Operations/Platform (CloudWatch, CI/CD), and FinOps (cost tagging, right-sizing). The BRD emphasizes MEC compliance, encryption, observability, and a phased cutover with hypercare.",

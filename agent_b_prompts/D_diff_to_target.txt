You are modernizing from CURRENT to TARGET under guardrails and must output ArchitectureSpec XML.

[SCHEMA]
... (schema) ...

[CURRENT from BRD]
{{BRD_TEXT}}

[GUARDRAILS]
{{GUARDRAILS_TEXT}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- In <Decisions> and <Patterns>, reflect the TARGET state, not current.
- Add <Risks> for migration hazards (e.g., data model changes, eventual consistency).
- Map to cloud primitives in <CloudMapping> consistent with guardrails.
- XML only.
